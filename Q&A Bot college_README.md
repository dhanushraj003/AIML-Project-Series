admission queries.

information from previous interactions.
- Implement a mechanism for the chatbot to provide more personalized
responses.

- Integrate the chatbot with a backend system to fetch real-time
admission-related information.
- Ensure the chatbot responses are up-to-date and accurate.
5. Error Handling and Feedback:

queries it cannot answer.
- Provide users with helpful feedback when their queries cannot be addressed.
